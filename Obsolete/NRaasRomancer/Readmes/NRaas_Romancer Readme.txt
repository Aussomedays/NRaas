NRaas_Romancer

MOD

This mod adds a new menu called "Romancer" to all Ficus plants in the game.

The "Romancer" menu contains the following interactions:

"Set Relationship" : Allows the user to specify the relationship between two sims
"Bump to Higher Level" : Increases the romance level between the active sim and another
"Bump to Lower Level" : Decreases the romance level between the active sim and another
"Set to Level" : Gives the user a list of eligible romance levels to choose from
"Query Partner" : Shows the user the name of a specified sim
"Version" : Displays the version of the mod

All eligible sims on the active sim's lot will be listed for selection.

Children are not allowed to use the "Bump to Higher Level" or "Bump to Lower Level" interactions.

NOTES

The Relationship panel may not always update immediately after changing the relationship.  Simply switch to a different panel and back, and it should update.

In Sims 3, a sim may have only a single "partner" at any one time, though can have as many romantic interests as they wish.

WARNING

As always, ensure that you backup your save files prior to installation of this mod.  This mod is horribly simple, but if anything can go wrong, it will go wrong.

You will receive a warning if you attempt to Bump the romance level of blood related sims.  The mod however will proceed to do so if you desire.

Be aware that setting blood related spouses may cause undefined results on the Family Tree window.

Have Fun. :)
